Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/tmp

I'll analyze the codebase to understand the build system, code style, and conventions, then create an AGENTS.md file for agents working in this repository.

Created AGENTS.md with essential guidelines for Rails 8 app development. The file covers build commands (RSpec testing with single file/line options), code style (HAML views, SASS styling, Rails conventions), and key patterns observed in the codebase (CanCan authorization, session-based auth with OTP, FactoryBot testing).

## Analysis Summary

This is a well-structured Rails 8 notes application with solid architecture and security practices. Here are my observations:

### Strengths:
- **Clean MVC architecture** with proper separation of concerns
- **Strong security practices**: CanCan authorization, HTTPS enforced, OTP 2FA support, secure password handling
- **Modern Rails patterns**: Uses concerns for shared functionality, proper validations, and Rails conventions
- **Quality testing**: 736 lines of comprehensive feature tests using RSpec + Capybara covering authentication flows
- **No technical debt**: No TODO/FIXME comments found
- **Performance awareness**: Uses `includes(:user)` to prevent N+1 queries in Note search

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Limited test coverage**: Only 4 test files for 56 Ruby files - missing unit tests for models/controllers
2. **Hard-coded OTP test secret**: `OTP_TEST_SECRET` should use environment variables instead of constants
3. **SQL injection risk**: The `cross_constraint` method in `Constrainable` builds raw SQL with string interpolation - should use parameterized queries
4. **Missing error handling**: Controllers lack comprehensive exception handling beyond CanCan
5. **No API versioning**: Routes don't indicate API structure for potential future expansion

### Minor Issues:
- Some complex regex patterns in `Constrainable` could benefit from documentation
- The `Remarkable` module handles image preprocessing that references undefined `Picture` model
- No explicit logging strategy for security events (failed logins, etc.)

Overall, this is a solid, secure Rails application with good architectural decisions, though it could benefit from broader test coverage and addressing the SQL injection vulnerability.
